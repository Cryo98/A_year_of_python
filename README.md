# A Year of Python
A personal project to improve my python skills by programming each day for a year.

Begin date: _still do be defined_

End date: _not yet reached_

## Introduction
The projects will focus on a specific library each week, trying to play with the most amount of tools available in that library, and will (<s>hopefully</s>) increase in difficulty as time goes by, possibly combining tools from different libraries and _maybe_ work on a bigger project in multiple days, but still by posing defined steps to work into that day.

I will try to document as well as possible the different scripts, trying to follow good coding practice (this means correct syntax, compartmentation, type hinting, documentation and commenting, but also leaving notes regarding the learning process).

## Workflow
The workflow will be as following:
* At the beginning of the week decide (if I haven't done so already previously) what library to focus onto.
* Look at the documentation to find macroareas or just general concepts that could be interesting to work with.
* Search the internet for inspiration.
* Define the project for each day of the week.
* Try to code for the project

## Rules
* I'm allowed to look up other people's code, but not to use it.
* For a project to be deemed completed it doesn't require complete functionality, reaching the base objective is enough.
* The code has to be commented and documented, else it is not considered completed.
* I can postpone a project only due to severe reasons (ex. important health issues, unavoidable tasks that take from morning to evening and similar)
